# MOOCs
Data analytics in action with several MOOCs

This project involves an analysis of several MOOC platforms around the world. The main idea is grasp in this market, discover the characteristics behind the hype and looking what things are really important for a startup interested in making a deep dive in this business.

The EDA notebook makes the usual cleaning and transforming tasks for many datasets. Unfortunately, the useful data is scarse in them, so I was working hard looking for other sources en the web.

The dashboard was designed in Power Bi and many visualizations were done with Python scripts, transferring the job done during the EDA phase to production. WordCloud graph and many other ones where implemented with this mechanism.

From the beginning, I was very interested in achieve a balance between quantitative vs qualitative metrics. Doing so, I feel that task was done fairfully.
